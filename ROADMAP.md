# Sayless Roadmap

## Never Miss a Message - Future Features

### VIP Protection
Emails from VIP contacts can't be scroll-triaged as "done" - require explicit action (swipe or tap a button). Prevents accidentally archiving important messages from key people.

### Snooze
Add a snooze triage target that hides the email until a specific time (later today, tomorrow, next week), then resurfaces it in the inbox.

### Unanswered Thread Detection
If you sent a message and haven't heard back in X days, surface it as a reminder. Helps follow up on outbound emails that may have been missed.

### Daily Digest Notification
Push notification: "You have 3 emails marked for reply that are > 2 days old". Gentle nudge without being intrusive.

### Undo Window
Brief "Undo" toast after triaging, in case you accidentally archived something important. 5-second window to reverse the action.

### Weekly Review
Surface emails you triaged as "done" from important senders that you never responded to. Catch things that slipped through.
